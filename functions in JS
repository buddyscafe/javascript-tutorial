functions in JS are same as any other OOP language like java, except the below points:

To create a function use the 'function' keyword.
Function Arguements are not type bounded not even 'var'
for example:
function sayHello(name,age) {
 console.log("Hello "+ name);
}

Flexible Argument count:
For example:
sayHello("Anand"); //Method is defined with two arguments, but it will run even if you supply only one argument considering second one as undefined.
sayHello("Anand",29,"Extra Argument"); //In this case, it will run even ignoring the Extra argument.
