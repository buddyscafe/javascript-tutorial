Javascript

Objects in js are free formed, i.e., You don't need to have a class to create an object.
Objects in js are created independently.
for example:
var myObj = {}; //This will create an empty object, holding no properties or behaviour.

Objects in js works like a Map in java.
As there is no concept of Classes in js, it's not structured and hence, all the properties of any object are publicly accessible.
In js, accessing a property of any obejct, which does not exist, will return undefined. while If we do the same in java or any class based OOP language will give a compile time error.

Object Literal Notation, To create an object with properties upfront, below is the Syntax.

var myObj = {
"prop1": "Hello",
"prop2": 123
};

New Properties can be added to object directly.
Objects can have methods.
